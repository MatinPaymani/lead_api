 It is a simplified version of an implementation of a lead API, i.e. an API to save leads from a website and store this information alongside a correlation ID
 (the ID of the whitepaper the lead has tried to download).

*This sample implements GET, POST, PUT and DELETE method for CRUD operation and also adds Log4net to enable logging post requests in a file and
the logger does not log entries when the unit-test is executed.

*The test-project reflects what goes on in the leadAPI.
